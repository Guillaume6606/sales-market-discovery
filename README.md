### API Usage

#### eBay Integration
```bash
# Trigger eBay ingestion
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/trigger?keyword=iPhone"

# Trigger eBay sold items only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/trigger-sold?keyword=iPhone&limit=50"

# Trigger eBay listings only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/trigger-listings?keyword=iPhone&limit=50"
```

#### LeBonCoin Integration
```bash
# Trigger LeBonCoin ingestion
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/leboncoin/trigger?keyword=iPhone"

# Trigger LeBonCoin listings only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/leboncoin/trigger-listings?keyword=iPhone&limit=50"

# Trigger LeBonCoin 'sold' items (recent listings as proxy)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/leboncoin/trigger-sold?keyword=iPhone&limit=50"
```

#### Vinted Integration
```bash
# Trigger Vinted ingestion
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/vinted/trigger?keyword=Nike"

# Trigger Vinted listings only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/vinted/trigger-listings?keyword=Adidas&limit=50"

# Trigger Vinted 'sold' items (recent listings as proxy)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingestion/vinted/trigger-sold?keyword=Zara&limit=50"
```

#### Status and Statistics
```bash
# Get ingestion status and statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/ingestion/status
```

### Automated Scheduling
- **eBay ingestion**: Daily at 2:00 AM
- **LeBonCoin ingestion**: Daily at 3:00 AM
- **Vinted ingestion**: Daily at 4:00 AM
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking ingestion via Arq workers

### Dev commands
```bash
make fmt        # format with ruff/black
make lint       # lint
make test       # run pytest
make up         # docker compose up -d
make down       # docker compose down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Setup Issues

#### Playwright Browser Installation
If you encounter issues with Playwright browser installation in Docker:

1. **Build fails**: The ingestion container will attempt to install browsers at startup
2. **Permission issues**: Ensure Docker has sufficient permissions for browser downloads
3. **Network issues**: Playwright downloads may fail due to network restrictions

**Manual browser installation** (if needed):
```bash
# Install browsers manually
docker compose exec ingestion poetry run playwright install chromium

# Or install all browsers
docker compose exec ingestion poetry run playwright install
```

#### Scraping Dependencies
The ingestion container includes all necessary system dependencies for web scraping:
- GTK libraries for GUI rendering
- Audio libraries for browser audio
- X11 libraries for display simulation

### Environment Variables

Configure these in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Scraping behavior
SCRAPING_MIN_DELAY=1.0      # Minimum delay between requests (seconds)
SCRAPING_MAX_DELAY=3.0      # Maximum delay between requests (seconds)
SCRAPING_TIMEOUT=30.0       # Request timeout (seconds)
SCRAPING_MAX_RETRIES=3      # Maximum retry attempts

# Playwright settings
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true    # Run browsers in headless mode
PLAYWRIGHT_SLOW_MO=0        # Slow down actions (for debugging)

# Optional: Proxy settings
HTTP_PROXY=                 # HTTP proxy URL
HTTPS_PROXY=               # HTTPS proxy URL
```

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `poetry install`
2. **Browser not found**: Playwright browsers may need manual installation
3. **Permission denied**: Check Docker container permissions for browser downloads
4. **Rate limiting**: Adjust `SCRAPING_*_DELAY` values if hitting rate limits

### Browser Fingerprinting Stealth Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test to evaluate how discreet your browser setup is against fingerprinting detection using both CreepJS and BrowserScan:

#### Quick Test
```bash
# Run stealth test inside container
./test-stealth-container.sh
```

#### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Run test (headless mode - recommended)
docker compose exec -e RUN_STEALTH_TEST=true ingestion /start-ingestion.sh

# Alternative: Run with GUI mode (requires xvfb)
docker compose exec ingestion xvfb-run -a python /app/test-stealth.py

# New: Run with ScrapingSession integration (uses scraping.py configuration)
docker compose exec ingestion python /app/test-stealth-config.py
```

#### Test Results Interpretation
- **üü¢ Excellent (0-10% detection)**: Very discreet setup
- **üü° Good (10-30% detection)**: Moderately discreet
- **üü† Moderate (30-60% detection)**: Some detection risk
- **üî¥ Poor (60%+ detection)**: Highly detectable

**Test Coverage:**
- **CreepJS**: WebRTC, Canvas/WebGL, fonts, timezone, plugins, and comprehensive fingerprinting
- **BrowserScan**: WebDriver detection, User-Agent analysis, CDP detection, Navigator properties

**Test Scripts:**
- **`test-stealth.py`**: Original test script with direct Playwright usage
- **`test-stealth-config.py`**: New script using ScrapingSession from `scraping.py` for consistent configuration

**Analysis Areas:**
- WebRTC fingerprinting and device detection
- Canvas/WebGL rendering consistency
- Browser properties and headers
- Automation tool detection
- Timing and behavior patterns
